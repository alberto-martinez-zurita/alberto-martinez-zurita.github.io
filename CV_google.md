## ⚡ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Senior Solutions Architect** with 20+ years of experience in Banking and Critical Systems, now operating at the bleeding edge of **Agentic AI**.

I combine the rigor of enterprise architecture (Security, Scalability, Governance) with the agility of modern AI engineering. My value proposition is unique: I don't just prototype AI; I design the **frameworks and governance** required to deploy it at scale in regulated environments.
* **Global Winner:** 1st Place in Google Cloud AI Agents Hackathon (Enterprise Category).
* **Thought Leader:** Creator of the **DIRECTOR** Prompt Engineering method and the **CLEAR** Software Health Framework.
* **Builder:** Proven track record of orchestrating multi-agent systems, local inference pipelines, and RAG architectures.

## 🏆 ELITE AI MILESTONES (2024-2025)

### **🥇 1st Place Winner - Google AI Agents Hackathon (Enterprise Track)**
*December 2025 | Global Competition (4,477 submissions)*
**Project:** [**Chaos Playbook Engine ($AI^2$)**](https://github.com/alberto-martinez-zurita/chaos-playbook-engine)
* **The Challenge:** Agents in production are fragile. They fail unpredictably.
* **The Solution:** Engineered a **Chaos Engineering** framework for AI Agents. Injected systematic faults (timeouts, API failures) to train recovery strategies via RAG.
* **Engineering:** Hybrid Architecture (Deterministic Python + Probabilistic LLM). Ran **1,000+ parametric experiments**, proving a **60% increase in reliability** (from 37% to 98% success rate under chaos).
* **Stack:** Google ADK, Vertex AI (Gemini), Docker, Poetry, Plotly.

### **🧠 Proprietary Methodologies & Frameworks**
* **Framework CLEAR (Health Score):** Ideated and led the development of a holistic software health metric system (Cognitive, Lifecycle, Elasticity, Availability, Risk, Resource). Currently adopted to measure technical debt across enterprise portfolios.
* **DIRECTOR Method:** A structured Prompt Engineering framework developed to standardize human-AI interaction. Taught to **350+ corporate employees**, bridging the gap between non-technical staff and LLM capabilities.

### **🏭 "La Colmena" & GreenOps AI Pipelines**
* **Agentic Swarm (Python):** Built a local orchestration engine where specialized agents (Architect, Dev, QA) collaborate via GitHub to build software autonomously.
* **Z-Image-Turbo (Video Gen):** Automated video production pipeline using Local Open Source Models (GreenOps). Orchestrates Image Gen, TTS, and Audio processing on consumer hardware (RTX 3060), optimizing inference costs.
